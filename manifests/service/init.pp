# == Define: serf::service::init
#
# This class exists to coordinate all service management related actions,
# functionality and logical units in a central place.
#
# <b>Note:</b> "service" is the Puppet term and type for background processes
# in general and is used in a platform-independent way. E.g. "service" means
# "daemon" in relation to Unix-like systems.
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*ensure*]
#   String. Controls if the managed resources shall be <tt>present</tt> or
#   <tt>absent</tt>. If set to <tt>absent</tt>:
#   * The managed software packages are being uninstalled.
#   * Any traces of the packages will be purged as good as possible. This may
#     include existing configuration files. The exact behavior is provider
#     dependent. Q.v.:
#     * Puppet type reference: {package, "purgeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
#     * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
#   * System modifications (if any) will be reverted as good as possible
#     (e.g. removal of created users, services, changed log settings, ...).
#   * This is thus destructive and should be used with care.
#   Defaults to <tt>present</tt>.
#
# [*status*]
#   String to define the status of the service. Possible values:
#   * <tt>enabled</tt>: Service is running and will be started at boot time.
#   * <tt>disabled</tt>: Service is stopped and will not be started at boot
#     time.
#   * <tt>running</tt>: Service is running but will not be started at boot time.
#     You can use this to start a service on the first Puppet run instead of
#     the system startup.
#   * <tt>unmanaged</tt>: Service will not be started at boot time and Puppet
#     does not care whether the service is running or not. For example, this may
#     be useful if a cluster management software is used to decide when to start
#     the service plus assuring it is running on the desired node.
#   Defaults to <tt>enabled</tt>. The singular form ("service") is used for the
#   sake of convenience. Of course, the defined status affects all services if
#   more than one is managed (see <tt>service.pp</tt> to check if this is the
#   case).
#
# [*init_defaults*]
#   Defaults file content in hash representation
#
# [*init_defaults_file*]
#   Defaults file as puppet resource
#
# [*init_template*]
#   Service file as a template
#
